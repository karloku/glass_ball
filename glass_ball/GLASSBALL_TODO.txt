Tired of landing and seizing planets that you do not want? 
This mod allows you just to glass it into ruins! 

After fully bombardment of a planet, you can choose whether to glass it or nuke it. Glassing makes a planet no longer colonizable. 

Feature:
After a full bombardment and the fortification health of the bombarded planet is reduced to 0, you can choose to
1. glass the planet. remove all creatures from the planet, and make the planet into an uncolonizable dead world.
2. nuke the planet. remove all creatures from the planet, and make the planet into a tomb world.
3. do nothing

TODO: 
1 check bombarding fleet. fleet with low millitary power has no ability to perform glassing. 
2 make a policy to set glassing allowed or prohibited. 
3 glassing is not cheap. all rulers will blame on your savage acts. even your pop may be unhappy. 
4 re-colonizable a glassed planet.
